    "__Cross-validation__ is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by testing it on multiple subsets of the data. The idea is to partition the data into several subsets, train the model on one subset, and test it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated multiple times, with each subset being used as the test set at least once. The results are then averaged to get an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. Cross-validation is useful for estimating the generalization performance of a model and can help to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, __RMSE__ is a measure of the accuracy of a regression model. It is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. RMSE is commonly used as an evaluation metric for regression models because it provides a measure of how far the predictions are from the true values.\n",

    "The choice of a good indicator for cross-validation performance depends on the specific problem and the data at hand. However, there are some common indicators that can be used to assess the performance of a machine learning model using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used indicator is the mean absolute error (MAE), which measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Lower values of MAE indicate better performance, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another commonly used indicator is the root mean squared error (RMSE), which measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Like MAE, lower values of RMSE indicate better performance, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third commonly used indicator is the coefficient of determination (R-squared), which measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. R-squared values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a good indicator for cross-validation performance depends on the specific problem and the data at hand. However, for many machine learning problems, an MAE or RMSE of less than 0.5 or an R-squared value of greater than 0.7 may be considered a good indicator of performance."
