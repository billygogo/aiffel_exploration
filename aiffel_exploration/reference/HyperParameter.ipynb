    "When using GradientBoostingRegressor, there are several hyperparameters that can be tuned using Grid Search to improve the performance of the model. Here are some of the most important hyperparameters to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning rate: This hyperparameter controls the amount that each new tree contributes to the overall prediction. Lower values typically lead to better generalization, but may require more trees to achieve the same level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of trees: This hyperparameter determines the total number of trees in the ensemble. Increasing the number of trees can improve the accuracy of the model, but may also increase the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum depth: This hyperparameter determines the maximum depth of each decision tree. Deeper trees can capture more complex relationships in the data, but may also overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimum samples split: This hyperparameter determines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Increasing this value can help to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subsample: This hyperparameter controls the fraction of training samples that are used to train each tree. Using a smaller subsample can help to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loss function: This hyperparameter determines the loss function used to optimize the model. The default loss function is 'ls' (least squares), but other options include 'lad' (least absolute deviation) and 'huber' (a combination of least squares and least absolute deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "By tuning these hyperparameters using Grid Search, you can optimize the performance of the GradientBoostingRegressor for your specific problem."
